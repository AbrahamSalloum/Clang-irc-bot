gcc -lpthread irc.c 
./a.out irc.foonetic.net 6667 (or any other  well behaving server/port combo)

Basic (bad) skeleton for bot, accepts from stdin the following:
QUIT - quits 
JOIN #chan - join chan
NICK newnick - changes nick
PRIVATE <user> - starts private chat with <user>, to exit: JOIN #chan
<anything else> - public/private msg to chan/<user>

buffer overflows are everywere
output is raw  stream
