gcc -lpthread irc.c 
./a.out irc.foonetic.net 6667 (or any other  well behaving server/port combo)

Basic (bad) skeleton for bot, accepts from stdin the following:
QUIT - quits 
JOIN #<chan> - join <chan>
NICK <newnick> - changes nick to <newnick>
PRIVATE <user> - starts private chat with <user>, to exit: JOIN #chan
LIST - Prints list of available chans
WHOIS <nick> - prints info of <nick>

<anything else> - public/private msg to chan/<user>

buffer overflows are everywere
output is a little raw.
